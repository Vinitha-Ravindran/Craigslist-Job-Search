10,INDY O/O'S ARE YOU STILL RUNNING FOR 1ST QUARTER RATES? $3K+ NET!,"     THIS IS WHAT YOUR COMPANY WILL NOT TELL YOU, BUT I WILL!  Try to visualize this map in your mind: all freight moving from the south going north to Detroit, MI and back west to Milwaukee, WI moves for an average of $2.50-$5.00 per mile, sometimes more, and the deadhead should be as minimal as 100 miles per week. If you are not getting at least 70% of those kind of rates you are being under paid!  All of these companies out there offering $.95-$1.50 plus FSC per mile are making approximately $2.00-$3.00 per mile on your truck after your cut, and that is ridiculous! This is the opportunity for you to get a fair percentage of daily market rates in what is more than likely the best market and economy most of us have ever seen in our professional careers! The consumer is spending, unemployment is lower than what it has been in 48 years, and freight is moving at incredible volume and the rates are higher than they have ever been in our industry! If the carrier you are signed on with isn't showing you these kind of rates, then one of two things are happening: (1) they are hauling extremely cheap freight, or (2) they are not being honest with you about how much they are being paid--""probably the second scenario""! You should be running for a minimum of $2.00 per mile to your truck after the carrier's cut, and that is a ""minimum"" of $2.00 per mile. Most of the time you should be making more than $2.00 per mile!  We email all of our O/O's every contract and rate con for every load you haul! You see every rate on the real contract, not some make believe contract/rate sheet that a crooked operations manager put together on an excel spreadsheet! We are pretty sure we are the only company in this area doing this!  Our owner operators take home $3000-$4000 every week after fuel and deductions, not gross that's take home, with an average of around 2200-2500 miles per week!  Notice the lack of ""BS"" in this ad/rant; that's because this program was designed and developed by a former O/O of over 20 years! We truly understand what it takes to run a truck, support maintenance and make the money you should be making! RESPECT and HONESTY are the most important aspects of our company!  Ask your dispatcher to send you the rate sheet, and if he says ""NO"" then they are skimming money off the top! If they are giving you a true percentage of the rate they should show you the contract ""rate con"" and anyone running for mileage pay is definitely being under paid!  We are a locally owned and operated trucking company. We have 24 hour dispatch. Everyone in our operations office is either a former driver or the son/daughter/wife of a driver. Our Safety Director drove for 20 years before becoming our Safety Director 14 years ago!  We have plenty of regional lanes for O/O's and company drivers! We do have long haul as well for the drivers who like to stay out longer!   NO CONTAINERS! NO MICROMANAGING! NO NICKEL-AND-DIMING!  NO AGE LIMIT ON TRUCKS! 99'S AND OLDER ARE WELCOME!  WE OFFER: <>MAINTENANCE HELP PROGRAM <>100% NO TOUCH FREIGHT <>PRE-PASS PLUS ELITE  <>BASE PLATE PROGRAM <>IFTA PROGRAM--WE FILE YOUR FUEL TAXES FOR YOU <>100% FREE TRAILER USAGE WITH NO MAINTENANCE COST TO YOU <>NO CARGO INSURANCE EXPENSSES  <>ROADSIDE INSPECTION BONUS <>RIDER POLICY <>COMDATA FUEL CARDS <>WEEKLY SETTLEMENTS <>ADP PAYROLL CO.

248,"Professionals wanted, % pay, 70-75mph trucks and no BS","     I'm sure you've read a ton of recruiter postings on here. I'm not one. I'm a driver for the company I'm making this posting for. Renewable Transportation Services is the name. We are a reefer company out of Indianapolis. Here's the high points, no BS;  Employee type - W2  Experience - At least a year. Minimum. Preferably more, but thats the minimum requirement  Company - Family owned, 35ish trucks. Vet friendly  Accidents etc - If you have a messed up record, lots of accidents and tickets, don't apply. We aren't interested. A couple dings is fine. But habitual tickets are not.  % pay - we are sent the rate contracts as our dispatch, so we see exactly what the gross is, including fuels surcharge (this is as close to hub mile pay as you will ever get). Whatever that number is , subtract 19 cpm as what the truck eats for operation. Everything else, you get your % of (including fuel surcharge). For instance, I've taken 900 mile loads to Florida that payed $3600 gross. So you'd take 3600 and subtract 171 (19cpm), leaving the gross at 3439. I personally make 31%, so I'd make $1062 for that 900 mile run. These are real examples.  Understand however that runs on the east coast don't pay nearly as well, so you take a hit coming back. However, the pay going in makes it worth it. I routinely see checks between 1500-1800 for a given week. Usually Ill have a 1000-1200 gross week, following by a 1600-2000 gross check. for instance last week I grossed 7300 for the week to the truck. After deductions etc, I'll make around 1950 or so gross for 1 week.  Dispatch - We get a number of loads a week and get to pick which one we want for the most part. There is some seniority involved in that obviously as far as loads out of the terminal, but with backhauls you have a lot of say. I actually have a DAT load board membership and have chosen my loads myself on multiple occasions. You get to have direct input with our dispatcher on where you go out of a list of loads.   Routing and Fuel - you decide both. You wont be told where to fuel or what roads to take. Take the ones you think are best. Fuel at any pilot or flying J. To quote our operations manager ""This is a big boy operation. Pick up and deliver on time. For everything in between, that's why we have you""  Trucks - We're mostly new cascadias, with some internationals still atm as well. Owner has decided he wants to switch out the internationals for T680s though last I checked, and we are supposed to be getting some of those in relatively soon. Believe he bought 5. The Cascadia in the picture is mine, taken in late October 2019  We have insurance , paid time off, Paid Holidays, generous vacation and all the rest as well.  For experienced drivers who want to be treated like they know what they are doing and payed well, this is the best job you're ever going to find. I'm a 17 year driver myself, and this is BY FAR the best place I've ever worked. It's not even a contest.  Im going to leave our Recruiters phone number attached to this add (his names Carlos), tell him Jason sent you his way. My truck number is 19006 for reference. He can give you the finer details and answer any questions    ",% of load gross, full-time,"2789,2885,2889,2898,2905,3037,3429"
